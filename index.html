    <h4 class="post-title">When I understood my running talent</h4>
    <div class="post-content">
<p>I was about 10 and we’d been travelling through north of Iran as we do every summer. We arrived to Bandar Anzali, a coastal city, and found a motel to stay. Then I went by the sea for a short walking but suddenly, there was a family of stray dogs staring at me!
First they were just looking at me to see if I am a threat or not. They made a conclusion after I barked at them. The male dog started running after me and so did I. <em> I was felling the warmth of his breath just behind my leg </em>. I was just 10 but running like a <strong>30 years old runner</strong>.
I mean my speed was about <strong>15 mile per hour</strong>. I was shouting and asking for help but even though my father could have hear me, he was just relaxing in the motel enclosure. I was out of breath but I had to make it. Finally after of running a kilometer, I jumped into the enclosure.
That’s the end of this nightmare but also when my running journey began.</p>
